# Creative react component
A project / lab where I can experiment animation in react.  
 [You can check the demo](https://creative-react-components.netlify.app/)

I tried to make all animation as reusable as possible.  
Some animation are vanilla, but I also added library :  
- [Framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- [R3F react-three-fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction)

Styling made with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
